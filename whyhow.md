# Purpose (Why)

We are very good consumers of Open Source software at SVT. We use a large number of frameworks and products - however we can be better at contributing back and optimize our own usage.

Therefore the technical board took the decision that:

*We (SVT) should strive to work with open source*  
*There will be a virtual team, actively working with the first decision*

We believe that we can benefit from a Open Source strategy in many ways:

*Better quality of our code (by patching and contributing back to external projects we use)*  
*Better knowledge of the software we base our products on and that SVT's fundamental mission is dependent on*  
*PR (both general and for recruiting), respect and more recognition for SVTi as a modern and open tech company that is giving back to society in alignment with its public service mission*  
*Developer satisfaction and even more engagement*  
    ...

# Focus areas (What?)

We can identify four areas were SVT could do a lot better regarding open source.
For SVT's part specifically, we are focusing on 1), 2) and 3):

1. Contribute
2. Publish
3. Correct usage of
4. Requisition and comparisons when buying a new product

# Virtual team

Current team leads are Björn Molin and Josef Andersson.

The virtual team intend to have regular meetings once every other month, or when needed.

The current purpose of the group is to:

*Support the teams and individuals in working with open source*  
*Work out guidelines*  
*Oversight of the health of public projects from SVT*  
*Keep contact with others, internal and externa*  
*Other activities - blog, speakers, hackday etc.*  
*Contribution culture*  

# Guidelines

## Copyright

Everything we code under working hours is, just like expected, copyright SVT.

## Identity

There must be a clear distinction between the identities one use if you contribute to a project as a private individual or as a SVT-employee

Therefore we use our SVT-identity when commiting - in other words, commit with a name@svt.se address.

The GitHub account that we use for commiting to an SVT project must have an real name in the name settings.

## Licenses 

Use an [OSI (Open Source Initiative) approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses).

An [GPL or MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/) should be good for most cases.

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) should also be fine for non code.

## Maintenance

The product teams are autonomous and is responsible for maintenance.

If a project is not active any more, it should be clear in the project README-file.

## Contributing to open source projects

One does not need permission to contribute to an existing open source project. However, when an organization CLA is required, contact your open source leads.

Make sure the contribution is quality checked by a colleague before pushing to an public repo.

## Starting a new open source project

Before submitting a new open source project, make sure your team and product owner is all onboard.

Check with your open source leads.

## Source code repositories

We publish our open source projects at SVT's github. 

The GitHub-presentation page is https://svt.github.io/
