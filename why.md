We are very good consumers of Open Source software at SVT and use a large number of Open Source frameworks and products.

To improve our participation we decided that:

*We (SVT) should strive to work with open source*  
*There will be a virtual team, actively working with the first decision*

We can benefit from an Open Source strategy in many ways, for example by:

*Better quality of our code (by patching and contributing back to external projects we use)*  
*Better knowledge of the software we base our products on and that SVT's fundamental mission is dependent on*  
*Branding and recognition as an open organisation that is giving back to society in alignment with its public service mission*  
*Developer satisfaction and even more engagement* 
*Better collaboration with organisations and individuals
