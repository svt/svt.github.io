All of the material in this suite may be distributed, modified and used freely (complete or in parts) as per the Creative Commons license described further down below.

All of the content was captured in 3840x2160p50 using professional equipment, and the outmost care has been taken during the post-production process to ensure that visual quality is retained. The data itself is provided in various different resolutions and formats, however no effort has been made to grade the content or otherwise make it more aesthetically pleasing.

- [Video material (with other material, at the Xiph resource list)](https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/)

All sequences from this set were filmed in 50 fps with professional, high end 65mm film
equipment by SVT in October 2004. The utmost care has been taken when converting the
film into digital data, the same applies for all conversion steps applied afterwards.

The data itself comes in various different resolutions which are widely used – all in 50 Hz
motion portrayal. Lower resolutions were gained by filtering the 2160p/50 master. At all
resolutions the bit depth is full interval 16 bits per (RGB) colour plane to obtain the very high
quality of the original shots.

### Copyright

All sequences from this set may be distributed freely (complete or in parts) as long as the
copyright and the restrictions of the use of the sequences are not violated.
This documentation has to be distributed with any part of the test set that is distributed.
It is not allowed to charge a fee for the distribution of the sequences.

Individuals and organizations extracting sequences from this archive agree that the sequences
